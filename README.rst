SYNOPSIS
========

stbt record [options]

stbt run [options] [script]


DESCRIPTION
===========

**stbt record** will record a test case by listening for remote-control
keypresses, taking screenshots from the set-top box as it goes.

You then (manually) crop the screenshots to the region of interest.

(Optionally) you manually edit the generated test script, which will look
something like this::

    press("MENU")
    wait_for_match("Guide.png")
    press("OK")
    wait_for_match("BBC One.png")

**stbt run** will play back the given test script, returning an exit status of
success or failure for easy integration with your existing test reporting
system.

**stbt** has other auxiliary sub-commands; run `stbt --help` for details.


OPTIONS
=======

Global options
--------------

--control=<uri>
  A remote control to use for controlling the set top box. `uri` can be:

  lirc:([<lircd_socket>]|[<hostname>:]<port>):<remote_control_name>
    A hardware infrared emitter controlled by the lirc (Linux Infrared Remote
    Control) daemon.

    * If `lircd_socket` is specified, remote control commands are sent via a
      lircd socket file. `lircd_socket` defaults to `/var/run/lirc/lircd`.
    * If `port` is specified, remote control commands are sent via a lircd TCP
      listener on localhost.
    * If `hostname` and `port` are specified, remote control commands are sent
      via a lircd TCP listener on a remote host.

    `remote_control_name` is the name of a remote-control specification in
    lircd.conf.

    Examples:
        | lirc:/var/run/lirc/lircd:myremote
        | lirc:8700:myremote
        | lirc:192.168.100.100:8700:myremote

  irnetbox:<hostname>:<output>:<config_file>
    RedRat irNetBox network-controlled infrared emitter hardware.
    `hostname` is the hostname or IP address of the irNetBox device.
    `output` is the infrared output to use, a number between 1 and 16
    (inclusive). `config_file` is the configuration file that describes the
    infrared protocol to use; it can be created with RedRat's (Windows-only)
    "IR Signal Database Utility".
    stbt supports the irNetBox models II and III.

  vr:<hostname>:<port>
    A "virtual remote" that communicates with the set-top box over TCP.
    Requires a virtual remote listener (which we haven't released yet) running
    on the stb.

  none
    Ignores key press commands.

  test
    Used by the selftests to change the input video stream. Only works with
    `--source-pipeline=videotestsrc`. A script like `press("18")` will change
    videotestsrc's pattern property (see `gst-inspect videotestsrc`).

--source-pipeline=<pipeline>
  A gstreamer pipeline providing a video stream to use as video output from the
  set-top box under test.  For the Hauppauge HD PVR use::

      v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! mpegtsdemux ! video/x-h264 ! decodebin2

--sink-pipeline=<pipeline>
  A gstreamer pipeline to use for video output, like `xvimagesink`.

-v, --verbose
  Enable debug output.

  With `stbt run`, specify `-v` twice to enable GStreamer element dumps to
  `./stbt-debug` directory. Note that this will dump a *lot* of files --
  several images per frame processed. To group the images by frame, sort the
  files by timestamp. This is intended for debugging the GStreamer elements; it
  isn't intended for end users.

Additional options to stbt record
---------------------------------

--control-recorder=<uri>
  The source of remote control presses.  `uri` can be:

  lirc:([<lircd_socket>]|[<hostname>:]<port>):<remote_control_name>
    A hardware infrared receiver controlled by the lirc (Linux Infrared Remote
    Control) daemon. Parameters are as for `--control`.

  vr:<hostname>:<port>
    Listens on the socket <hostname>:<port> for a connection and reads a
    "virtual remote" stream (which we haven't documented yet, but we'll
    probably change it soon to be compatible with LIRC's protocol).

  file://<filename>
    Reads remote control keypresses from a newline-separated list of key names.
    For example, `file:///dev/stdin` to use the keyboard as the remote control
    input.

-o <filename>, --output-filename=<filename>
  The file to write the generated test script to.


CONFIGURATION
=============

All parameters that can be passed to the stbt tools can also be specified in
configuration files. Configuration is searched for in the following files (with
later files taking precedence):

1. /etc/stbt/stbt.conf
2. ~/.config/stbt/stbt.conf
3. $STBT_CONFIG_FILE

These files are simple ini files with the form::

    [global]
    source_pipeline = videotestsrc
    sink_pipeline = xvimagesink sync=false
    control = None
    verbose = 0
    [run]
    script = test.py
    [record]
    output_file = test.py
    control_recorder = file:///dev/stdin

Each key corresponds to a command line option with hyphens replaced with
underscores.


EXIT STATUS
===========

0 on success; 1 on test script failure; 2 on any other error.

Test scripts indicate **failure** (the system under test didn't behave as
expected) by raising an instance of `stbt.UITestFailure` (or a subclass
thereof). Any other exception is considered a test **error** (a logic error in
the test script, an error in the system under test's environment, or an error
in the test framework itself).


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================

The test rig consists of a Linux server, with:

* A video-capture card (for capturing the output from the system under test)
* An infrared receiver (for recording test cases)
* An infrared emitter (for controlling the system under test)

Video capture card
------------------

You'll need a capture card with drivers supporting the V4L2 API
(Video-for-Linux 2). We recommend a capture card with mature open-source
drivers, preferably drivers already present in recent versions of the Linux
kernel.

The Hauppauge HD PVR works well (and works out of the box on recent versions of
Fedora), though it doesn't support 1080p. If you need an HDCP stripper, try the
HD Fury III.

Infra-red emitter and receiver
------------------------------

An IR emitter+receiver such as the RedRat3, plus a LIRC configuration file
with the key codes for your set-top box's remote control.

Using software components instead
---------------------------------

If you don't mind instrumenting the system under test, you don't even need the
above hardware components.

stb-tester uses gstreamer, an open source multimedia framework. Instead of a
video-capture card you can use any gstreamer video-source element. For example:

* If you run tests against a VM running the set-top box software instead
  of a physical set-top box, you could use the ximagesrc gstreamer
  element to capture video from the VM's X Window.

* If your set-top box uses DirectFB, you could install the DirectFBSource
  gstreamer element (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=685877) on the
  set-top box to stream video to a updsrc gstreamer element on the test rig.

Instead of a hardware infra-red receiver + emitter, you can use a software
equivalent (for example a server running on the set-top box that listens on
a TCP socket instead of listening for infra-red signals, and your own
application for emulating remote-control keypresses). Using a software remote
control avoids all issues of IR interference in rigs testing multiple set-top
boxes at once.

Linux server
------------

An 8-core machine will be able to drive 4 set-top boxes simultaneously with at
least 1 frame per second per set-top box.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================

* A Unixy operating system (we have only tested on Linux and Mac OS X).

* Drivers for any required hardware components.

* gstreamer 0.10 (multimedia framework) + gst-plugins-base + gst-plugins-good.

* python (we have tested with 2.6 and 2.7; on <2.7 you will also need to
  install the python-argparse package) + pygst + docutils (for building
  the documentation) + nose (for the self-tests).

* OpenCV (image processing library) version >= 2.0.0.

* For the Hauppauge video capture device you'll need the gstreamer-ffmpeg
  package (e.g. from the rpmfusion-free repository) for H.264 decoding.


INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
======================

Run "make install" from the stb-tester source directory.

See http://stb-tester.com/getting-started.html#install-stb-tester-from-source
for the required dependencies.


SETUP TIPS
==========

Use "gst-inspect stbt-templatematch" to check that gstreamer can find the
templatematch element. You may need to set GST_PLUGIN_PATH to point
where you installed libgst-stb-tester.so.

Run tests/run-tests.sh to verify that your gstreamer + OpenCV installation is
working correctly.

If you plan to use real infrared emitters/receivers, use lirc's irsend(1) and
ircat(1), respectively, to test your lirc setup before integrating with
stb-tester.


TEST SCRIPT FORMAT
==================

The test scripts produced and run by **stbt record** and **stbt run**,
respectively, are actually python scripts, so you can use the full power of
python. Don't get too carried away, though; aim for simplicity, readability,
and maintainability.

The following functions are available:

.. <start python docs>

press(key)
    Send the specified key-press to the system under test.

    The mechanism used to send the key-press depends on what you've configured
    with `--control`.

    `key` is a string. The allowed values depend on the control you're using:
    If that's lirc, then `key` is a key name from your lirc config file.

wait_for_match(image, timeout_secs=10, consecutive_matches=1, noise_threshold=None, match_parameters=MatchParameters())
    Search for `image` in the source video stream.

    Returns `MatchResult` when `image` is found.
    Raises `MatchTimeout` if no match is found after `timeout_secs` seconds.

    `consecutive_matches` forces this function to wait for several consecutive
    frames with a match found at the same x,y position. Increase
    `consecutive_matches` to avoid false positives due to noise.

    The templatematch parameter `noise_threshold` is marked for deprecation
    but appears in the args for backward compatibility with positional
    argument syntax. It will be removed in a future release; please use
    `match_parameters.confirm_threshold` instead.

    Specify `match_parameters` to customise the image matching algorithm. See
    the documentation for `MatchParameters` for details.

press_until_match(key, image, interval_secs=3, noise_threshold=None, max_presses=10, match_parameters=MatchParameters())
    Calls `press` as many times as necessary to find the specified `image`.

    Returns `MatchResult` when `image` is found.
    Raises `MatchTimeout` if no match is found after `max_presses` times.

    `interval_secs` is the number of seconds to wait for a match before
    pressing again.

    The templatematch parameter `noise_threshold` is marked for deprecation
    but appears in the args for backward compatibility with positional
    argument syntax. It will be removed in a future release; please use
    `match_parameters.confirm_threshold` instead.

    Specify `match_parameters` to customise the image matching algorithm. See
    the documentation for `MatchParameters` for details.

wait_for_motion(timeout_secs=10, consecutive_frames=10, noise_threshold=0.84, mask=None)
    Search for motion in the source video stream.

    Returns `MotionResult` when motion is detected.
    Raises `MotionTimeout` if no motion is detected after `timeout_secs`
    seconds.

    Considers the video stream to have motion if there were diferences between
    10 consecutive frames, or the number specified by `consecutive_frames`,
    which can be:

    * a positive integer value, or
    * a string in the form "x/y", where `x` is the number of frames with motion
      detected out of a sliding window of `y` frames.

    Increase `noise_threshold` to avoid false negatives, at the risk of
    increasing false positives (a value of 0.0 will never report motion).
    This is particularly useful with noisy analogue video sources.

    `mask` is a black and white image that specifies which part of the image
    to search for motion. White pixels select the area to search; black pixels
    the area to ignore.

detect_match(image, timeout_secs=10, noise_threshold=None, match_parameters=MatchParameters())
    Generator that yields a sequence of one `MatchResult` for each frame
    processed from the source video stream.

    Returns after `timeout_secs` seconds. (Note that the caller can also choose
    to stop iterating over this function's results at any time.)

    The templatematch parameter `noise_threshold` is marked for deprecation
    but appears in the args for backward compatibility with positional
    argument syntax. It will be removed in a future release; please use
    `match_parameters.confirm_threshold` intead.

    Specify `match_parameters` to customise the image matching algorithm. See
    the documentation for `MatchParameters` for details.

detect_motion(timeout_secs=10, noise_threshold=0.84, mask=None)
    Generator that yields a sequence of one `MotionResult` for each frame
    processed from the source video stream.

    Returns after `timeout_secs` seconds. (Note that the caller can also choose
    to stop iterating over this function's results at any time.)

    `noise_threshold` is a parameter used by the motiondetect algorithm.
    Increase `noise_threshold` to avoid false negatives, at the risk of
    increasing false positives (a value of 0.0 will never report motion).
    This is particularly useful with noisy analogue video sources.

    `mask` is a black and white image that specifies which part of the image
    to search for motion. White pixels select the area to search; black pixels
    the area to ignore.

save_frame(buf, filename)
    Save a GStreamer buffer to the specified file in png format.

    Takes a buffer `buf` obtained from `get_frame` or from the `screenshot`
    property of `MatchTimeout` or `MotionTimeout`.

get_frame()
    Get a GStreamer buffer containing the current video frame.

get_config(section, key)
    Read the value of `key` from `section` of the stbt config file.

    See 'CONFIGURATION' in the stbt(1) man page for the config file search
    path.

    Raises `ConfigurationError` if the specified `section` or `key` is not
    found.

debug(msg)
    Print the given string to stderr if stbt run `--verbose` was given.

class MatchParameters
    Parameters to customise the image processing algorithm used by
    `wait_for_match`, `detect_match`, and `press_until_match`.

    `match_method` (str) default: sqdiff-normed
      The method that is used by the OpenCV `cvMatchTemplate` algorithm to find
      likely locations of the "template" image within the larger source image.

      Allowed values are ``"sqdiff-normed"``, ``"ccorr-normed"``, and
      ``"ccoeff-normed"``. For the meaning of these parameters, see the OpenCV
      `cvMatchTemplate` reference documentation and tutorial:

      * http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/object_detection.html
      * http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/histograms/template_matching/template_matching.html

    `match_threshold` (float) default: 0.80
      How strong a result from `cvMatchTemplate` must be, to be considered a
      match. A value of 0 will mean that anything is considered to match,
      whilst a value of 1 means that the match has to be pixel perfect. (In
      practice, a value of 1 is useless because of the way `cvMatchTemplate`
      works, and due to limitations in the storage of floating point numbers in
      binary.)

    `confirm_method` (str) default: absdiff
      The result of the previous `cvMatchTemplate` algorithm often gives false
      positives (it reports a "match" for an image that shouldn't match).
      `confirm_method` specifies an algorithm to be run just on the region of
      the source image that `cvMatchTemplate` identified as a match, to confirm
      or deny the match.

      The allowed values are:

      "``none``"
          Do not confirm the match. Assume that the potential match found is
          correct.

      "``absdiff``" (absolute difference)
          The absolute difference between template and source Region of
          Interest (ROI) is calculated; thresholded and eroded to account for
          potential noise; and if any white pixels remain then the match is
          deemed false.

      "``normed-absdiff``" (normalized absolute difference)
          As with ``absdiff`` but both template and ROI are normalized before
          the absolute difference is calculated. This has the effect of
          exaggerating small differences between images with similar, small
          ranges of pixel brightnesses (luminance).

          This method is more accurate than ``absdiff`` at reporting true and
          false matches when there is noise involved, particularly aliased
          text. However it will, in general, require a greater
          confirm_threshold than the equivalent match with absdiff.

          When matching solid regions of colour, particularly where there are
          regions of either black or white, ``absdiff`` is better than
          ``normed-absdiff`` because it does not alter the luminance range,
          which can lead to false matches. For example, an image which is half
          white and half grey, once normalised, will match a similar image
          which is half white and half black because the grey becomes
          normalised to black so that the maximum luminance range of [0..255]
          is occupied. However, if the images are dissimilar enough in
          luminance, they will have failed to match the `cvMatchTemplate`
          algorithm and won't have reached the "confirm" stage.

    `confirm_threshold` (float) default: 0.16
      Increase this value to avoid false negatives, at the risk of increasing
      false positives (a value of 1.0 will report a match every time).

    `erode_passes` (int) default: 1
      The number of erode steps in the `absdiff` and `normed-absdiff` confirm
      algorithms. Increasing the number of erode steps makes your test less
      sensitive to noise and small variances, at the cost of being more likely
      to report a false positive.

    Please let us know if you are having trouble with image matches so that we
    can further improve the matching algorithm.

class MatchResult
    * `timestamp`: Video stream timestamp.
    * `match`: Boolean result.
    * `position`: `Position` of the match.
    * `first_pass_result`: Value between 0 (poor) and 1.0 (excellent match)
      from the first pass of the two-pass templatematch algorithm.

class Position
    * `x` and `y`: Integer coordinates from the top left corner of the video
      frame.

class MotionResult
    * `timestamp`: Video stream timestamp.
    * `motion`: Boolean result.

class MatchTimeout(UITestFailure)
    * `screenshot`: A GStreamer frame from the source video when the search
      for the expected image timed out.
    * `expected`: Filename of the image that was being searched for.
    * `timeout_secs`: Number of seconds that the image was searched for.

class MotionTimeout(UITestFailure)
    * `screenshot`: A GStreamer frame from the source video when the search
      for motion timed out.
    * `mask`: Filename of the mask that was used (see `wait_for_motion`).
    * `timeout_secs`: Number of seconds that motion was searched for.

class UITestFailure(Exception)
    The test failed because the system under test didn't behave as expected.

class UITestError(Exception)
    The test script had an unrecoverable error.

TEST SCRIPT BEST PRACTICES
==========================

* When cropping images to be matched by a test case, you must select a region
  that will *not* be present when the test case fails, and that does *not*
  contain *any* elements that might be absent when the test case succeeds. For
  example, you must not include any part of a live TV stream (which will be
  different each time the test case is run), nor translucent menu overlays with
  live TV showing through.

* Crop template images as tightly as possible. For example if you're looking
  for a button, don't include the background outside of the button. (This is
  particularly important if your system-under-test is still under development
  and minor aesthetic changes to the UI are common.)

* Always follow a `press` with a `wait_for_match` -- don't assume that
  the `press` worked.

* Use `press_until_match` instead of assuming that the position of a menu item
  will never change within that menu.

* Use the `timeout_secs` parameter of `wait_for_match` and `wait_for_motion`
  instead of using `time.sleep`.

* Rename the template images captured by `stbt record` to a name that explains
  the contents of the image.

* Extract common navigation patterns into separate python functions. It is
  useful to start each test script by calling a function that brings the
  system-under-test to a known state.
