Description: Automated User Interface testing for set-top boxes. 
 stb-tester tests a set-top-box by issuing commands to it using a remote-control
 and checking that it has done the right thing by analysing what is on screen.
 Test scripts are written in Python and can be generated with the `stbt record`
 command.
