Instructions to deploy a new stb-tester version to the OpenSUSE Build Service
=============================================================================

The OpenSUSE Build Service (OBS) builds stb-tester RPM and deb packages
available at http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/stb-tester/
based on the stb-tester.spec file and the contents of debian/ in this
directory.

To build a new release:

    yum install osc  # The OpenBuildService command-line client
    make obs-publish # You will need to know the password! :-)

The new packages can take up to an hour to appear at
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/stb-tester/

Currently packages are built for Fedora 17 to 20 (x86 and x86_64), OpenSUSE
12.2+ and Debian 7.0.  To add other architectures and distros see
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Astb-tester

We don't currently build packages for RHEL6 because of missing dependencies
python-docutils and opencv-devel. Presumably these are already available from
other projects within the OpenSUSE Build Service, and we just need to configure
our OBS project to find those packages.

We don't currently build packages for Ubuntu because we depend on packages in
the ubuntu "universe" repository which OBS doesn't allow.  An Ubuntu Personal
Package Archive is more appropriate for this anyhow.
