class Keyboard(object):
    """Helper for navigating an on-screen keyboard using the remote control.

    You customize for the appearance & behaviour of the keyboard you're testing
    by specifying two things:

    * A `Page Object`_ that can tell you which key is currently selected on the
      screen. See the ``page`` parameter to ``enter_text`` and ``navigate_to``,
      below.

    * A `Directed Graph`_ that specifies the navigation between every key on
      the keyboard (for example on a qwerty keyboard: when Q is selected,
      pressing KEY_RIGHT on the remote control goes to W, and so on). See the
      ``graph`` parameter below.

    The constructor takes the following parameters:

    :type graph: str or networkx.DiGraph
    :param graph: A specification of the complete navigation graph (state
        machine) between adjacent keys, as a multiline string where each line
        is in the format ``<start_node> <end_node> <action>``. For example, the
        specification for a qwerty keyboard might look like this::

            '''
            Q W KEY_RIGHT
            Q A KEY_DOWN
            W Q KEY_LEFT
            <etc>
            '''

        For nodes that enter a character, use that character as the node name.
        For the space-bar use SPACE. For other nodes that don't enter a
        character when pressed, use a descriptive name such as CLEAR or ENTER
        (these nodes won't be used by ``enter_text`` but you can use them as a
        target of ``navigate_to``).

        On some keyboards, buttons like the space-bar are wider than other
        buttons and the navigation away from the button depends on the previous
        state. Our ``graph`` can't model this state, so specify all the
        possible transitions from the button. For example, on a qwerty
        keyboard::

            SPACE C KEY_UP
            SPACE V KEY_UP
            SPACE B KEY_UP
            SPACE N KEY_UP
            SPACE M KEY_UP

        For advanced users: instead of a string, ``graph`` can be a
        `networkx.DiGraph` where each edge has an attribute called ``key`` with
        a value like ``"KEY_RIGHT"``. If your keyboard's buttons are positioned
        in a regular grid, you can use `stbt.grid_to_navigation_graph` to
        generate this graph (or part of the graph, and then you can add any
        irregular connections explicitly with `networkx.DiGraph.add_edge`).
        See also `Keyboard.parse_edgelist`.

    :type mask: str or `numpy.ndarray`
    :param str mask:
        A mask to use when calling `stbt.press_and_wait` to determine when the
        current selection has finished moving. If the search page has a
        blinking cursor you need to mask out the region where the cursor can
        appear, as well as any other regions with dynamic content (such as a
        picture-in-picture with live TV). See `stbt.press_and_wait` for more
        details about the mask.

    :type navigate_timeout: int or float
    :param navigate_timeout: Timeout (in seconds) for ``navigate_to``. In
        practice ``navigate_to`` should only time out if you have a bug in your
        ``graph`` state machine specification.

        :param str text: The text to enter. If your keyboard only supports a
            single case then you need to convert the text to uppercase or
            lowercase, as appropriate, before passing it to this method.

        :param stbt.FrameObject page: An instance of a `stbt.FrameObject`
            sub-class that describes the appearance of the on-screen keyboard.
            It must implement the following:

            * ``selection`` (*str* or `Keyboard.Selection`) — property that
              returns the name of the currently selected character (for example
              "A" or " ") or button (for example "CLEAR" or "SEARCH"). This
              property can return a string, or an object with a ``text``
              attribute that is a string.

              For grid-shaped keyboards, you can map the region of the
              selection (highlight) to the corresponding letter using
              `stbt.Grid` (see the example below).

            The ``page`` instance that you provide must represent the current
            state of the device-under-test.

        Typically your FrameObject will provide its own ``enter_text`` method,
        so your test scripts won't call this ``Keyboard`` class directly. For
        example::
